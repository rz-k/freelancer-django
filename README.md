## #Quick Setup 
  Fir of all you need to install the `PostgreSQL`  package in your system and activate the `Postgres service`.<br>

  The second step is to install library dependence whit exists in the `reqruements.txt` you can install it by this command below:
  ```
  pip install -r requrements.txt
  ```
  
  Then We need to export all environment variables to initialize project configurations.
  <details>
     <summary>Config</summary>
     <p>You can change or set DB, email, Django or etc.. configurations in /freelancer-django
/config/.dev_env file.<br><br></p>
  </details>
  
  ```
  export $(grep -v '^#>' ./config/.dev_env | xargs);
  ```
  After all, you can run the project by 3 commands below:
  ```
  python manage.py makemigrations 
  python manage.py migrate
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
